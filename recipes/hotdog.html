    <img src="../images/hotdog.jpg"/>
    <h2>A classic seattle styled hotdog</h2>
    <p>I found this recipe online once and decided to try it out. Feautring a basting of cream cheese and sprinkling of sauted onions this dish
        is a delight for any day of the week. From getting the ingredients out of the frige to eating this meal takes around 15 minutes!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hotdog buns</li>
      <li>Hotdogs (Any kind you prefer)</li>
      <li>Cream cheese</li>
      <li>White Onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Begin by slicing an onion and putting it into a pan with butter.</li>
      <li>Let the onions slowly cook until they are fully sauted (Brownish looking and clumping together like strings)</li>
      <li>Toast your hotdog bun using whatever method you prefer. I like to toast mine on a pan on both sides with butter, But a toaster works just fine!</li>
      <li>Microwave or boil your hot dogs to cook them</li>
      <li>Now that everything is prepared you're going to want to Put cream cheese on the bun. (Both sides!) Put the hotdog in and then cover the top with onions</li>
