    <h2>A homemade Protein Ice Cream</h2>
    <p>I discovered this recipe from the cookbook of Greg Doucette (The Anabolic Cookbook 2.0)
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Protein Powder (Chocolate flavored)</li>
      <li>Xanthum gum</li>
      <li>PB2 Powder</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Ice</li>
      <li>Sweetner (Fake sugar)</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by putting ice into blender and grinding it down</li>
      <li>Follow this up by adding around half a cup of milk of your choice (Almond works best here)</li>
      <li>Blend that together and then add a full serving of your protein powder</li>
      <li>Add a serving of your PB2 powder (2 TBSPS)</li>
      <li>Blend that all together, It should be liquid at this point.</li>
      <li>Add in around 2 teaspoons of xanthum gum and 2 packets of your sweetner</li>
      <li>The xanthum gum will severely thicken this dish into making it the (Ice Cream) that it's supposed to be</li>
      <li>Once all blended together you're going to want to bowl it into a chilled bowl and eat</li>


    </ol>
